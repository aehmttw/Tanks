# Privacy Policy

## Data we collect
Tanks will not directly collect any data from its users. However, services that you may be using alongside Tanks 
(such as Steam, Discord, or the iOS App Store) may collect data from you when you use them, and we may receive some of that data from them. 
Please consult the privacy policies of these services for more information on the data they may collect, and on how it may be used.

## Personally-identifiable data
Tanks does not collect any information that can be used to personally identify users.

## Data we share
Tanks will not share any data it has obtained to any other companies for any purpose other than to keep the service running.
Data collected will not be sold for money to any company or individual.

## Updates to the privacy policy
Although we will do our best to let you know if we change this privacy policy, it may change without warning. 
Each privacy policy revision will only apply to versions of Tanks released after it.
